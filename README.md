# Udacity Deep Learning Nano-Degree

The [Udacity Deep-Learning Nano-Degree](https://eu.udacity.com/course/deep-learning-nanodegree--nd101)
gives a stepwise introduction into differenct approaches of deep learnings. Starting with fundamentals in implementing
a NN by hand, it extends the knowledge with building advanced NN with Tensorflow. This includes
image classification, LSTM for Text Generation, Seq-2-Seq model for text translations and GAN for image creation.
